# Online catalogs

## AstDyS

- https://newton.spacedys.com/astdys/
- Dynamical properties, osculating and proper elements, dynamical families.

## Asteroid Families Portal

- http://asteroids.matf.bg.ac.rs/fam/properelements.php
- Catalogs of proper elements and dynamical family membership

## Centre de Donn√©es de Strasbourg (CDS)

- http://cdsweb.u-strasbg.fr/
- Many catalogs from publications. However, the CDS is not built for moving objects.

## DAMIT

- https://astro.troja.mff.cuni.cz/projects/damit/
- 3D shape models of asteroids from light curve inversion tehcniques

## IMCCE SsODNet

- Form: https://ssp.imcce.fr/forms/ssocard
- API: https://ssp.imcce.fr/webservices/ssodnet/

Huge compilation of data from other resources listed here and published literature, view several levels of access:
- `quaero`: All names and aliases 
- `datacloud`: Bulk access to data 
- `ssocard`: Best properties for a given SSO
- `ssobft`: All best properties for all SSOs at once

## JPL sbdb

- Form: https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/tools/sbdb_lookup.html
- API: https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/api.html

Compilation of parameters from many sources.

## Lowell Observatory

- https://asteroid.lowell.edu/main/
- The ASTORB catalog of osculating elements and compilation of properties.

## M4AST

- https://spectre.imcce.fr/m4ast/
- A compilation of visible and near-infrared spectra of asteroids, with tools for analysis

## Minor Planet Center (MPC)

- https://minorplanetcenter.net/
- Central point for astrometric observations, observatory codes, orbits.

## NEODyS

- https://newton.spacedys.com/neodys/
- Similar to AstDyS, for NEAs

## OCA MP3C

- https://mp3c.oca.eu/
- Compilation of data from both large repositories and literature.

## PDS Small Body Node (PDS SBN)

- https://sbn.psi.edu/pds/
- Many standardized catalogs (well-documented PDS format) on SSOs, from space missions, observing campaigns and surveys, and derived properties.

## SSHADE

- https://www.sshade.eu/
- Collections of spectra acquired in laboratory (meteorites, ices, minerals)

## SiMDA

- https://astro.kretlow.de/?SiMDA
- Compilation of masses, diameters, and density of asteroids

## VESPA
- http://vespa.obspm.fr/planetary/data/
- Hub allowing to query many different services with a TAP interface
