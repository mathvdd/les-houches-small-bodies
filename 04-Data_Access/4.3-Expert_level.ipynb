    "# Build your own meteorite classifier\n",
    "\n",
    "In this expert part of the data-access tutorial, we see an example of how we\n",
    "can use our understanding of APIs to create useful tools for our daily\n",
    "research-life. The best tools are those that address a direct need in your\n",
    "analysis. Here, the example taken from real life is:\n",
    "\n",
    "*\"I need a function that accepts the name of one or many meteorites and returns their classification.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial explains in-depth how we can approach and solve this general idea. To find the final\n",
    "solution, we require basic knowledge of how data is sent to and from websites, which we explain below.\n",
    "You will see that the code itself to get this tool working is rather minimal.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 1: Identify the data source\n",
    "\n",
    "To get started, we need a database containing the information we are looking\n",
    "for: meteorite name-class relationships. The first thought: We could create a\n",
    "large text file with all known meteorite names and their classifications.\n",
    "However, we don't want to build and maintain this database ourselves. It's a\n",
    "lot of work and other services already do this for us.\n",
    "\n",
    "A good place for meteorite data is the [Meteoritical Bulletin](https://www.lpi.usra.edu/meteor/). The\n",
    "website does what we want: you enter a meteorite name and it returns basic\n",
    "information, including the classification. Great, the data that we are looking\n",
    "for is available somewhere on this website!\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the main page does not allow us to submit multiple objects at the same\n",
    "time. We could still make it work, however, the [Meteorite Name Checking\n",
    "Utility](https://www.lpi.usra.edu/meteor/metbullcheck.php) on the same website\n",
    "does allow us to send multiple objects, so we continue with this service.\n",

    "## Step 2: Identify an access protocol\n",
    "\n",
    "If we have more than a handful of meteorites that we want to look up, it\n",
    "quickly becomes tiring to type in their names on the website and submit the\n",
    "\"Search\" request. Instead, we want to do this programmatically. We need some\n",
    "way to communicate with the server via a script.\n",
    "\n",
    "We learned about different APIs to access data on remote servers this week:\n",
    "HTML POST requests using the `requests` module, using secondary data clients\n",
    "like `astroquery`, or the TAP services. Most databases specify at least one of\n",
    "these methods as their preferred access method for the user. However, there is\n",
    "no official API for the Meteoritical Bulletin. We thus have to be a bit\n",
    "creative to find a way to programmatically query our data.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you fill out a text form such as on this main page of the Meteoritical\n",
    "Bulletin and hit `Search`, you are in most cases executing what is called an\n",
    "HTML POST request. We saw this in notebook `3.1-How_to_query_an_API`, where we\n",
    "used the `requests.post` function to send data to a server. The same is\n",
    "happening when you click the `Search!` button: We are sending data to a URL. If\n",
    "we can find out what this data looks like and where it is sent to, we might be\n",
    "able to replicate this behaviour using the `requests` module.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, your browser can tell you exactly what data it is sending to which\n",
    "URL. This information is typically hidden in a \"Developer\" sub-menu. We use\n",
    "Mozilla Firefox here, but the same is possible in most browsers. With Firefox,\n",
    "you can right-click on the page and select \"Inspect\". You can see what this\n",
    "looks like in the figure below.\n",

    "data that we sent to the server and that we get from the server. When you open\n",
    "the inspection window, this tab is empty. If you then execute a search on the\n",
    "website (e.g. type in \"Vigarano\" and hit `Search`), you will see a \"POST\n",
    "request\" appear. This entry contains the data that we sent to the server, and\n",
    "the target URL. It also contains the server's response, which in this case is\n",
    "an HTML page (the page that it shows after you executed a search).\n",
    "\n",
    "The following information is relevant to us:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Domain and file that the request was sent to: `https://www.lpi.usra.edu/` and\n",
    "`meteor/metbullcheck.php`. This means that our target URL is\n",
    "`https://www.lpi.usra.edu/meteor/metbullcheck.php`, the page that we are on.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Request: The request contains the actual data that we sent. We see that there are two key-value pairs: `sea: Vigarano` and `Search: Search`.\n",
    "We deduce that the `sea` is the search term that we enter into the text form.\n",
