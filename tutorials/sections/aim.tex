\section*{Objectives}


The objective of this hands-on session is to introduce some of the most common
Virtual Observatory (VO) tools, such as 
\aladin \citep{2000A&AS..143...33B} and
\topcat \citep{2005ASPC..347...29T}, and 
a widely used protocol,
\texttt{cone-search},
to query data from archives.

We will start with a graphical user interface and then move to
using \python scripts to query Application Programming Interfaces (API)
and automatize the repetitive tasks.
